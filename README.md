# PHI-BLAST - The BLAST server for PHI-base

PHI-BLAST is a BLAST server that uses protein sequences from the Pathogen-Host Interaction database (PHI-base, [www.phi-base.org](www.phi-base.org)) as the database from which to perform BLAST search using a user-supplied sequence.

The PHI-BLAST tool is available from [http://phi-blast.phi-base.org/](http://phi-blast.phi-base.org/).


The original source code for PHI-BLAST was originally cloned from [SequenceServer](https://github.com/yannickwurm/sequenceserver), which in turn is based on the [BLAST+](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download) software.
